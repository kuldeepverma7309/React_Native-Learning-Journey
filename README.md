## Introduction

React Native is a framework developed by Facebook for building mobile applications using JavaScript and React. It allows you to create natively-rendered mobile apps for iOS and Android using a single codebase.

## Getting Started

To get started with React Native, you need to set up your development environment. Follow the official [React Native Getting Started guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started) to install the necessary tools and create your first React Native project.

## Basic Concepts

- **JSX**: JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to XML or HTML. It is used to describe the UI components in React Native.
- **Components**: Components are the building blocks of a React Native application. They can be either class-based or functional.
- **State and Props**: State and props are used to manage data and pass it between components.

## Components

Learn about the different types of components in React Native:

- **View**: The most basic component for building a UI.
- **Text**: Used to display text.
- **Image**: Used to display images.
- **ScrollView**: A scrollable container.
- **FlatList**: A performant interface for rendering lists.

## State and Props

- **State**: State is a built-in object that stores property values that belong to a component.
- **Props**: Props are read-only attributes used to pass data from one component to another.

## Navigation

Learn how to navigate between different screens in your React Native app using libraries like [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/).

## Styling

Understand how to style your components using the built-in `StyleSheet` and other styling libraries like [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/).

## Networking

Learn how to make network requests in React Native using `fetch` or libraries like [Axios](https://axios-http.com/).

## Debugging

Get familiar with debugging tools and techniques to troubleshoot issues in your React Native app.

## Advanced Topics

Explore advanced topics such as:

- **Animations**
- **Redux for state management**
- **Native Modules**
- **Performance Optimization**
